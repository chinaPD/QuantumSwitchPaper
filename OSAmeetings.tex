\begin{abstract}
Quantum key distribution provides an unconditional physical layer for secure communication.Study on switching and large-scale Networking problems in Quantum Communication could promote QKD communication to industrialization and practical. The current quantum switching nodes can only handle the wavelength of a specific bandwidth and have a strong constraint on the path of the transmission. And the spectrum reuse rate is very low. So it can't meet the demands of build large-scale network. This paper will present a WSS-based flattened flexible and non-blocking switching node that could support quantum communication and classic optical communication at the same time with multi-granularity.

\section{Introduction}
QKD uses non-orthogonal coded single photon states, such as single photon polarization, phase or angular momentum, to provide secure information exchange for two remote users. These all can be transmitted and switched same as classic optic signal in the fiber. 

\subsection{Typographical Style}
Margins and type size will be set by the OSA \LaTeX{}
commands for title, author names and addresses, abstract,
references, captions, and so on. The \texttt{osameet2.sty} package
references \texttt{mathptmx.sty} for Times text and math fonts.
Authors who require Computer Modern font may modify the style file
or, preferably, invoke the package \texttt{ae.sty} or similar for
optimum output with Computer Modern.

\subsection{Author Names and Affiliations}
Author names should be given in full with first initials spelled out to assist with indexing.
Affiliations should follow the format division, organization, and address---and complete postal information should be given.
Abbreviations should not be used. United States addresses should end
with ``, USA.''

\subsection{Abstract} The abstract
should be limited to no more than words. It should be an
explicit summary of the paper that states the problem, the methods
used, and the major results and conclusions. If another publication author is referenced in the abstract, abbreviated information
(e.g., journal, volume number, first page, year) must be
given in the abstract itself, without a reference number. (The item referenced in the abstract should be the first
cited reference  in the body.)

\subsection{OCIS Subject Classification} Two Optics Classification and
Indexing Scheme (OCIS) subject classifications should be placed at
the end of the abstract with the \verb+\ocis{}+ command. OCIS
codes can be found at
\href{http://www.osapublishing.org/submit/ocis/}{http://www.osapublishing.org/submit/ocis/}.

\subsection{Notation}
\subsubsection{General Notation}
Notation must be
legible, clear, compact, and consistent with standard usage. In
general, acronyms should be defined at first use.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Math Notation}
Equations should use standard \LaTeX{} or AMS\LaTeX{} commands (sample from Krishnan \textit{et al.} \cite{krishnan00}).

\begin{eqnarray}
\bar\varepsilon &=& \frac{\int_0ˆ\infty\varepsilon
\exp(-\beta\varepsilon)\,{\rm d}\varepsilon}{\int_0ˆ\infty
\exp(-\beta\varepsilon)\,{\rm d}\varepsilon}\nonumber\\
&=& -\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}\beta}\log\Biggl[\int_0ˆ\infty\exp
(-\beta\varepsilon)\,{\rm d}\varepsilon\Biggr]=\frac1\beta=kT.
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Tables and Figures}
Figures and illustrations should be incorporated directly into the
manuscript, and the size of a figure should be commensurate with the amount
and value of the information conveyed by the figure.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{OT10000F1}
\caption{Sample figure with preferred style for labeling parts.}
\end{figure}


\begin{table}[htb]
 \centering \caption{Sample Table}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    One & Two & Three \\
    \hline
    Eins & Zwei & Drei \\
    Un & Deux & Trois \\
    Jeden & Dv\v{e} & T\v{r}i \\
    \hline
   \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

 No more than
three figures should generally be included in the paper.
Place figures as close as possible to where they
are mentioned in the text. No part of a figure should extend beyond text width, and text should not wrap around figures.




\section{References}
References should be cited with the \verb+\cite{}+ command.
Bracketed citation style, as opposed to superscript, is preferred
\cite{krishnan00,vantrigt97,masters93,shoop97,kalman76,craig96,steup96}.
The \texttt{osameet2.sty} style file references \texttt{cite.sty}. Comprehensive journal abbreviations are available on the CrossRef web site:
